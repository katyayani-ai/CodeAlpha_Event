# CodeAlpha_Event
This project is an event registration system built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The application allows users to register for events, view detailed information about upcoming events, and manage their registrations effectively. By leveraging Django's powerful ORM capabilities, the system interacts with a SQLite database to store event data and user registrations seamlessly.

The event registration system features a user-friendly interface where users can browse through a list of events. Each event is presented with its name, description, and other relevant details, making it easy for users to find and register for events that interest them. The application supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling event administrators to manage events efficiently. Users can also manage their registrations, ensuring they have full control over their participation.

To set up this project locally, users need to have Python and Django installed. After cloning the repository, they can create and apply database migrations, set up a superuser account, and start the development server. This allows users to interact with the application in their web browsers, providing a hands-on experience with the event registration process.

The project serves as a practical example of using Django for web development, highlighting key features such as URL routing, template rendering, and database interactions. It is suitable for developers who are looking to understand the fundamentals of Django and how to build a complete web application from scratch. This system can be extended with additional features, such as user authentication, payment processing, and event categorization, to enhance its functionality and user experience further.
