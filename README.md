# CodeAlpha_Event
This project is a simple **event registration system** developed using **Django**, a popular Python web framework. The application allows users to **view** a list of events, **register** for those events, and manage their registrations in a straightforward manner. 

The system features a basic interface that displays event details such as **name** and **description**, enabling users to easily find events that interest them. It implements essential functionalities such as adding events and displaying them to users, with a focus on simplicity and usability.

To set up this project locally, users need to have **Python** and **Django** installed on their machines. After cloning the repository, users can run database migrations and start the development server to access the application in their web browsers. This provides a practical way to experience event registration and management.

Overall, this project serves as a useful example for those learning Django, demonstrating fundamental concepts like **model creation**, **view handling**, and **template rendering** while keeping the code simple and manageable. The system can be easily extended with additional features in the future, such as user authentication and enhanced event management options.
